# About

Leaderboard is a simple script to embed a student evaluation of teaching (SET) response leaderboard in any web page.  Originally designed for personal use and then used by others.

# Requirements

1. A publicly available Google spreadsheet ([for example](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1o7Dqv8XK54yVrvAmbJvsf88ot2QssSxUMJM4wP8q204/edit#gid=0)) with rows capturing multiple SET response rates
> Typically this is over multiple offerings. But some have used it to compare between different student cohorts. You will enter data about student response rates into this Google spreadsheet.
1. A web page (e.g. a part of a Moodle site) in which you can insert some HTML+Javascript (below)
> This HTML+Javascript will retrieve the content from the Google spreadsheet and display it to students

The following image is a representation of how it works.

# Why?

The purpose of the leaderboard is to increase response rates from students evaluating your teaching. [This page](http://djon.es/blog/2017/06/17/nudging-up-myopinion-response-rates-using-a-gamified-leaderboard/) provides more detail on why and the results in a number of courses.
